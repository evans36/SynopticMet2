    "In this week's lab, we will use ERA5 reanalysis data rather than GFS data to examine a case from 2012.  Reanalysis data such as ERA5 are generated retrospectively using a numerical model (in this case, the ECMWF model), archived observations, and data assimilation.  In contrast to a model analysis, a reanalysis typically incorporates more observations and a newer (hopefully improved!) model version.\n",

    "Although ERA5 is a gridded dataset, its gridding structure differs from that of GFS data, with a different file type (for the provided data; ERA5 data are also available in GRIB format, like with the GFS) and different variable names.  The former is not a major issue, however, since xarray opens netCDF files similarly to GRIB files so long as we change the decoding engine used by xarray to open the file.  \n",

The location of these datasets are provided for you below, as is the filename convention if you wish to use a datetime object to select your time of interest.\n",

You may find it helpful to refer to Lab 8's code when preparing these maps.  Be sure your maps follow the \"good map\" guidelines, and do not forget to import the necessary packages before you start coding.  "
