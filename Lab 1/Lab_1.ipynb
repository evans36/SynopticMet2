    "### Note on this Semester\n",
    "I will be more hands-off this semester with the Jupyter Notebooks in order to help you build confidence in your ability to create plots in Python.  I will continue to provide links to documentation for functions that will be useful for the lab, but I will not be giving step-by-step instructions on how to generate the maps.  In many cases, the data-processing and map creation codes you wrote last semester can be used for similar tasks this semester, and I encourage you to consult those labs as needed and to use these coding practices in the codes you generate this semester.  I will be available for questions if you have any issues writing your code, and I will occasionally give a short tutorial on a new function at the start of a lab's Notebook.\n",

    "This week's, we wish to calculate frontogenesis using equation 19 from the lecture notes.  Luckily for us, however, MetPy has a function that can do this for us.  To start this week's lab, I'll give a short tutorial on how to use this frontogenesis function.\n",

    "1. Below, you are given some sample data.  To calculate frontogenesis, we need potential temperature, the u- and v-wind components, and the distance between our grid points.  However, many model datasets (such as the GFS data we will use in this lab) only include temperature, wind components, pressure, latitude, and longitude, meaning that we need to use these variables to compute the ones we need.  Thus, for illustrative purposes, our sample data mimics what we would have from a GFS file."
